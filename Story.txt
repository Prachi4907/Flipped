The fable of the hare and the tortoise usually runs something like this.
A hare was making fun of a tortoise for moving so slowly. 
The tortoise, tiring of the hare’s gibes about how slow he was on his feet, eventually challenged the hare to a race. 
‘I’ll race you, hare,’ he said; ‘and I bet I’ll win the race.
The hare agreed to this challenge, and a fox was found who set the course of the race and to judge who had won at the end.
